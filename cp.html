    <p class="date">Last Updated: June 2023</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Disposable Camera App ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
    <p>The app requires access to your device's camera to provide its core functionality. Photos you take with the app are stored locally on your device.</p>
    
    <h3>1.2 Subscription Information</h3>
    <p>If you subscribe to our premium features, payment information is processed by Apple's App Store, not by us directly. We receive only confirmation of your subscription status, not your payment details.</p>
    
    <h3>1.3 Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We may collect anonymous usage statistics to help us improve the app, including how often features are used and app performance metrics.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <p>- Provide, maintain, and improve our app</p>
    <p>- Process and manage your subscription</p>
    <p>- Respond to your comments, questions, and requests</p>
    <p>- Analyze usage patterns to develop new features</p>
    <p>- Protect against fraud and unauthorized activity</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties except in the following circumstances:</p>
    <p>- With third-party service providers who help us operate our app</p>
    <p>- If required by law or to protect our rights</p>
    <p>- In connection with a business transfer such as a merger or acquisition</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Photos taken with our app are stored locally on your device. We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your information, but no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You can access and delete photos taken with our app through your device's file management system. You can manage subscription preferences through your App Store account settings.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
